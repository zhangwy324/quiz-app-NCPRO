                NCPRO staff would be divided into four groups
                based on your date
                of birth. Staff who were born in first quarter would be in group
                1, born in second quarter would be in group 2, etc.
                <br><br>
                Two volunteers from each group will participate in this
                multiple-choice question social game. The volunteer must answer
                questions correctly to stay in the game, he/she is out if the
                question was answered incorrectly.
                <br><br>
                All staff in his/her assigned group can help (search online, ask
                neighbors, call experts) to provide the correct answers but
                he/she must answer question directly. Each question must be
                answered in 1 minute or less. Staff are free to support other
                group volunteers if the volunteers in your group lost and are
                out from game.
                <br><br>
                The volunteer who provides the most correct answers and stay to
                end of the game will win and get an award. All staff in the
                winner's group will come to stage to get a group picture.
